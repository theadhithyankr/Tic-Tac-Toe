2. Upload your icon.png
3. Remove/replace white background with transparent or #0f172a

OPTION 3: Keep White Background (Still looks good!)
- White can work well as a contrast
- Your app will stand out among other dark-themed apps
- The adaptive icon background will still be dark

ðŸš€ NEXT STEPS TO BUILD:
1. If you want to change the background, edit the icon
2. Run: eas build --platform android --profile preview
3. Your new app will have:
   - Name: "XOX Game"
   - Your custom icon
